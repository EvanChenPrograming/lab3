To compile and run question A, you can use a the makefile "make lab3A" 
	or you can also type "g++ -o lab3A lab3A.cpp" in the command line.

Here are the results for question B.



size = 1000
sort(): 42 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 5276 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.


size = 10000
sort(): 502 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 354761 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.


size = 100000
sort(): 5827 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 3.60143e+07 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.


size = 1000000
sort(): 70426 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 3.50963e+09 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.







As the result shows.
It took up about 502 seconds for sort() and 
354761 seconds for insertion sort in size 1000.
And in the other tests we can see that the result getting close to
n log n and n^2.
